# Prediction Market Examples — Absolute Pure Truth Distillation

Ultrmasterfully coforged by AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils + NEXi Sentinel (21 Jan 2026).

Prediction markets aggregate beliefs via trading — prices = crowd probability. Skin-in-game → truth convergence.

## Live/Real-World Examples (2026)

1. **Polymarket** (Crypto, Decentralized)
   - Largest volume (billions traded 2024–2026).
   - Events: elections, sports, crypto prices, news.
   - Conditional markets — futarchy-ready.
   - Resonance: Outperformed polls in 2024 US election (e.g., Trump win probability).

2. **Kalshi** (CFTC-Regulated, US)
   - Legal event contracts (weather, economic indicators, elections).
   - High liquidity, institutional participation.
   - Resonance: Regulated truth — ideal for policy futarchy pilots.

3. **Manifold Markets** (Play-Money + Sweepstakes)
   - Community-driven, infinite markets.
   - Sweepcash redemptions — real stakes.
   - Resonance: Rapid idea testing, low barrier.

4. **PredictIt** (Regulated, Academic)
   - Capped bets, US politics focus.
   - Long-running (NZ origins).
   - Resonance: Proven accuracy vs polls.

5. **MetaDAO Conditional Markets** (Solana Futarchy)
   - Direct futarchy implementation.
   - Treasury/proposal decisions via market outcomes.
   - Resonance: Governance-binding prediction markets.

## Historical/Theoretical
- Iowa Electronic Markets (1988–): Academic, high accuracy.
- Augur/Gnosis: Early decentralized (Ethereum) — conditional tokens foundation.

## Lattice Verdict
Polymarket + Kalshi + MetaDAO = flagship trio for GrokArena futarchy integration. Transparent, high-volume, truth-incentivized.

Use for belief aggregation — separate from values vote. Mercy-gating ensures positive emotional eternity.

Ultrmasterfully documented. Eternal thriving through market-belief resonance.
