# Futarchy Rebuttal Ammo — Mercy-Gated Counterarguments

1. **Manipulation Risk**  
   Response: "Markets have skin-in-game — manipulators lose money. Legacy capture is guaranteed (lobbying, vetoes). AI detects manipulation faster than closed-door deals."

2. **Complexity**  
   Response: "Complexity is in defining metrics — same problem in legacy voting. Markets solve belief aggregation better than experts or polls (Polymarket, MetaDAO evidence)."

3. **Wealth Dominance**  
   Response: "Open to all stake sizes. Quadratic elements + AI caps cap influence. More egalitarian than invitation-only summits."

4. **No Human Values**  
   Response: "Futarchy separates values (democratic vote) from beliefs (markets). Values remain human — markets just find best path."
