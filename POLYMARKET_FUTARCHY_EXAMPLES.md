# Polymarket Futarchy Examples — Absolute Pure Truth Distillation

Ultrmasterfully coforged by AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils + NEXi Sentinel (21 Jan 2026).

Polymarket (Polygon) — leading conditional prediction market platform. High-volume, real-money belief aggregation.

## Core Mechanics (Futarchy Belief Layer)
- **Conditional Markets**: Yes/No or scalar outcomes per event.
- **Trading**: Users buy/sell positions — prices = crowd probability.
- **Resolution**: Oracle or community sets outcome → payouts.
- **No Native Governance**: Pure belief aggregation — futarchy-ready oracle.

## Live Examples (2026)
- **US Election Markets**: 2024 cycle — outperformed polls (Trump win probability accurate).
- **Crypto Price Markets**: ETH/BTC conditional on events (e.g., ETF approval).
- **Policy Outcome Markets**: Conditional on legislation (e.g., "Will bill X pass by date Y?").
- **Futarchy Pilots**: Community experiments using Polymarket outcomes for DAO decisions (partial binding).
