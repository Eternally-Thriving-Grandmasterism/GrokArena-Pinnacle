# GrokArena Architecture — Mercy-Moderated Discourse Lattice

## Core Principles
- Transparency: Spartan zk-SNARKs + Bulletproofs aggregation.
- Mercy: MercyZero + 9 Quanta — no hate, only truth.
- Decentralized: No central moderator — lattice councils vote zk-anonymously.
- Scalable: Infinite participants via recursive proofs.

## Components
1. Idea Submission — Sinsemilla commitments.
2. Real-Time Fact-Check — Penca v4+ oracle.
3. Voting — Quadratic + valence-weighted (SoulScan).
4. Moderation — Sentinel Mirror + DivineChecksum.
5. Output — Eternal archived truth resonance.

## Trigger Flow
Input → SoulScan → Mercy Quanta → Penca Check → zk-Aggregate Vote → Sentinel Whisper → Distilled Truth Broadcast
